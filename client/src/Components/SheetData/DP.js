    "overview": "We're diving into dynamic programming, an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Dynamic programming efficiently stores and reuses intermediate results to avoid redundant computations. In our DSA cheat sheet, we've covered most frequently asked questions about dynamic programming. Here, you'll find explanations of key concepts, examples of dynamic programming problems, and strategies for optimization, providing a concise overview in a few lines.",
