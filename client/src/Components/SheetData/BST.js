    "overview": "We're diving into binary search trees (BST), a specialized form of binary trees with a defined ordering property. In a BST, the left subtree contains values less than the parent, and the right subtree contains values greater than the parent. In our DSA cheat sheet, we've covered most frequently asked questions about binary search trees. Here, you'll find operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, offering a concise overview of this crucial data structure.",
