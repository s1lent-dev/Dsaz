    "overview": "We're diving into linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Unlike arrays, linked lists store elements in nodes with pointers, allowing dynamic memory allocation. In our DSA cheat sheet, we explore different types of linked lists, operations like insertion and deletion, and advanced topics like circular and doubly linked lists, providing a comprehensive understanding of this versatile data structure.",
